    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Daniel Knox is a Design/Engineer & Product Design Lecturer with over 15 years of industry experience and four years in higher education across Nottingham Trent University, Chester University, and Wrexham University. His extensive career includes integral roles in creating performance solutions and life-saving equipment for the US Air Force and pioneering innovative designs for leading brands like Dyson and Unilever.</p>
    <p>Notably, Daniel worked on Survitec's largest project, the Integrated Aircrew Ensemble (IAE), during a multimillion-dollar research and development phase for the F-35 Lightning II pilot flight ensemble. His innovative use of materials led to efficiency and cost savings, and he successfully managed the project across multiple cultures and timezones, ensuring adherence to specification targets and key performance indicators set by the US Government.</p>
    <p>At Dyson, Daniel led engineering teams to deliver functional assemblies, mitigate risks, and drive specification targets. His role at Unilever involved bridging research and development with supply chain and procurement, resulting in an international patent for a sustainable packaging solution.</p>
    <p>Committed to fostering environmental awareness, Daniel mentored students in the Engineering Education Scheme Wales (EESW), helping them win a national sustainability award in 2023. As a lecturer, he shares his diverse industry insights to deepen students' learning with practical knowledge and real-world applications.</p>
    <p>Currently, Daniel contributes to the Ecological Citizen(s) Network+, collaborating with The Royal College of Art and The University of York's Stockholm Environment Institute to advance knowledge and inform policy and practice. As a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA), he is dedicated to interdisciplinary collaboration, innovation, and sustainable practices.</p>
